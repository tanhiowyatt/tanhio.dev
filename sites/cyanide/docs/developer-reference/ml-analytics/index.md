# Machine Learning & Analytics Documentation

Cyanide is more than just a interactive shell; it is an intelligent capture system. This section explains the logic behind its hybrid detection engine.

## Overview
The analytics layer provides real-time threat detection and classification. Instead of simple log collection, Cyanide analyzes commands for malicious patterns using a combination of static rules and neural network anomaly detection.

## How it Works
1.  **Rule Engine**: A fast, regex-based signature matcher for known threats.
2.  **ML Autoencoder**: Learns common shell patterns and scores deviations (high score = anomaly).
3.  **Context Analysis**: Weighs events based on session progression (e.g. sequence of `wget` -> `chmod` -> execution).

## Configuration
The thresholds for anomaly scoring and the specific rules to apply are defined in `configs/app.yaml` under the `ml` and `analytics` blocks. For more info, see the **[Configuration Guide](../core/configuration.md)**.
