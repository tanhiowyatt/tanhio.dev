# Core Service Documentation

The Core Engine of **Cyanide** is responsible for the overall lifecycle management of the honeypot, including configuration parsing, event orchestration, and the main server loop.

## Overview
Cyanide's core handles the transition between incoming network connections and the internal emulation logic. It acts as the "brain" that initializes services (SSH, Telnet), manages global security settings, and routes events to the analytics engine.

## How it Works
The core utilizes a central `CyanideServer` class built on top of `asyncio`. It starts multiple protocol-specific listeners and coordinates access to shared resources like the Virtual Filesystem (VFS) and the Statistics Manager.
