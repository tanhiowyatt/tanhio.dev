# Honeypot Services Overview

**Cyanide** provides several protocol-specific services. Each service is designed to be fully configurable via `app.yaml` or environment variables and integrates with the common VFS and detection engine.

##  Service Details

*   **SSH Interaction**: A deep-interaction SSH server using `asyncssh`. Supports both emulated and proxied backend modes.
*   **Telnet Service**: Low-latency Telnet server implementing the Telnet protocol state machine and RFC-compliant shell sessions.
*   **Metrics Server**: Internal Prometheus-compatible exporter for real-time monitoring of sessions, traffic, and security alerts.
*   **VMPool Manager**: Dynamic backend pool for managing proxied sessions into isolated micro-VMs.

## Detailed Documents
