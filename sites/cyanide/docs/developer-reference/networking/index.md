#  Networking Documentation

This section explains Cyanide's networking stack, focusing on its protocol handling and protocol-specific proxying.

## Overview
Cyanide facilitates communication between attackers and the honeyport engine via a custom asynchronous networking layer. It supports both emulated direct interaction and specialized MiTM (Man-in-the-Middle) proxying to isolated backends.

## How it Works
Communication is handled via `asyncio` transport layers. For SSH, we utilize `asyncssh` for protocol negotiation, while the **Proxy Layer** intercepts the decrypted stream and allows for real-time traffic modification and credential harvesting.

## Configuration
Network settings (ports, host binding, os_profile) are managed in `configs/app.yaml` under the `server` and `ssh` blocks. For more info, see the **[Configuration Guide](../core/configuration.md)**.
