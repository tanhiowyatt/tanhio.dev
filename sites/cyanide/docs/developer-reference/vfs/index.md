#  Virtual Filesystem (VFS) Documentation

The **Virtual Filesystem** layer provides a convincing Linux environment for the attacker. It manages dynamic file generation, memory overlays, and per-session file state mutations.

## Overview
Instead of exposing the host system's disk, Cyanide uses a purely in-memory filesystem representation. This allows for total isolation while still providing the attacker with a rich, interactive environment (files, directories, pipes).

## How it Works
The VFS resolves all attacker requests to `Node` objects. Changes are stored in a session-specific **memory overlay**, meaning an attacker can "delete" `/bin/ls` or "create" a folder without affecting the base installation or other concurrent sessions.

## Configuration
FileSystem structure is defined via **OS Profiles** in `configs/profiles/`. These YAML files specify the base file list, permissions, and initial content. Dynamic files (like `/proc/cpuinfo`) use custom providers.
